# subagent-isolation

> A `pi` extension that delegates tasks to a specialized subagent in an isolated `pi` process, giving the subagent its own clean context window.

## Features

- **Single invocation mode**
  - `single` - call one agent with a task: `{ agent: "name", task: "..." }`
- **Agent discovery & scoping**
  - `user` agents from `~/.pi/agent/agents/`
  - `project` agents from `.pi/agents/` (searched upward from the working directory)
  - `both` — merges both scopes (project overrides user on name collisions)
  - Optional `confirmProjectAgents` prompt before running repo-local agents
  - `agentScope` defaults to `"both"` at runtime
- **Process isolation & depth control**
  - Every subagent spawns a fresh `pi --mode json` process
  - Each subagent’s system prompt is written to a temporary file and passed via `--append-system-prompt`
  - Max recursion depth: `2`
  - Per-agent `canDelegate: false` in frontmatter blocks further delegation
- **Skill isolation**
  - Global skills can be cleared with `--no-skills`
  - Per-agent `skills` list injects only the specified skills via `--skill <path>`
- **Timeout & graceful termination**
  - Activity timeout: 10 minutes (kills if stdout is idle)
  - Hard timeout: 30 minutes
  - `AbortSignal` triggers `SIGTERM` → `SIGKILL` after 5 seconds
- **TUI rendering**
  - Real-time status with collapsible output (`Ctrl+O`)
  - Token usage stats: input / output / cacheRead / cacheWrite / cost / model / turns

## Installation

This extension is packaged as a [Pi Package](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-coding-agent). Install it directly inside `pi`:

```bash
pi install npm:subagent-isolation
```

This uses the `pi` npm loader, which resolves the package's `pi.extensions` entry points and aliases core imports to the installed `pi` runtime packages. No manual clone or global `npm install` is required.

## Usage

Agents are invoked via the `subagent` tool with `agent` and `task`.

### First call

```json
{
  "agent": "coder",
  "task": "Refactor the auth middleware to use async/await.",
  "cwd": "/optional/working/dir"
}
```

The returned text will end with the actual session ID:

```
<agent output>

[subagent session: 01912345-6789-7abc-8def-0123456789ab]
```

If the agent produces no output, the result is simply:

```
[subagent session: 01912345-6789-7abc-8def-0123456789ab]
```

### Reusing a session

Pass the `sessionId` from a previous call to continue the same isolated session:

```json
{
  "agent": "coder",
  "task": "Now add unit tests for the refactored auth middleware.",
  "sessionId": "01912345-6789-7abc-8def-0123456789ab"
}
```

The returned text still ends with `[subagent session: <id>]` so you can keep reusing it.

> ⚠️ **Concurrency warning**: Reusing the same `sessionId` from multiple concurrent `subagent` calls can corrupt the session file and interleave state. Only reuse a session ID for sequential calls, or ensure the subagent process has fully exited before reusing it.

## Agent Definition Format

Agents are defined as Markdown files (`.md`) in the agents directory. Frontmatter describes the agent; the body becomes the system prompt.

```markdown
---
name: coder
description: Writes clean TypeScript and handles refactors.
tools: read,edit,write,bash
model: claude-3-7-sonnet
skills: /path/to/skill1, /path/to/skill2
---

You are a senior TypeScript engineer. Prefer async/await, avoid callbacks.
```

### Frontmatter fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `name` | `string` | **Required.** Unique identifier used in tool calls. |
| `description` | `string` | **Required.** Short summary shown in discovery / error messages. |
| `tools` | `string[]` (comma-separated) | Optional tool whitelist for the subagent. |
| `model` | `string` | Optional model override (e.g. `claude-3-7-sonnet`). |
| `skills` | `string[]` (comma-separated) | Optional list of skill paths. If present, global skills are disabled and only these are loaded. Paths can be absolute or relative to the working directory. |
| `canDelegate` | `boolean` | Defaults to `true`. Set to `false` to prevent this agent from spawning further subagents. |

## Environment Variables

These variables control runtime behavior. They are propagated into every subagent process automatically.

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `PI_SUBAGENT_DEPTH` | `0` | Current recursion depth. Automatically incremented per nested invocation. Hard cap is `2`. |
| `PI_CAN_DELEGATE` | `true` | Whether the current agent is allowed to delegate. Derived from the agent's `canDelegate` frontmatter. |
| `PI_CURRENT_AGENT_NAME` | — | Name of the current agent, injected into every subagent process. |
| `PI_SUBAGENT_ACTIVITY_TIMEOUT_MS` | `600000` (10 min) | Max allowed idle time on stdout before the subagent is killed. |
| `PI_SUBAGENT_HARD_TIMEOUT_MS` | `1800000` (30 minutes) | Absolute maximum runtime for a single subagent call. |
